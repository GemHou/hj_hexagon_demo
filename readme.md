A simple python program to solve a geometry problem about hexagons by Monte Carlo method.

Problem description: Suppose there is a hexagon with a side length of 1 in a two-dimensional space, and a straight line passing through the hexagon at a random position and angle with uniform probability will form a line segment. Find the expected length of the line segment.

## Installation
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch

conda install matplotlib

pip install time

## Run
run hexagon.py

## Visualization
